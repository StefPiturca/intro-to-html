    <h1>Pupin Coils</h1>
    <P>Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils,archaically called
       "Pupin coils",followed closely on the pionerring work of the English psycist <br>
       and mathematicuab Oliver Heaviside,which predates Pupin's patent by 
       some seven years.
    </P>
   <p>The importance of patent was made clear when the Americans <br>
       rights to it were acquired by American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T),
       making him wealthy.</p>
    <p>Although AT&T bought pupin's patent,they made little use of it, <br>
        as they already had their own development in hand led by George Campbell and had up 
        to this point being challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent.
    </p>
    <p>AT&T were afraid they would lose control <br>
       of an invention which was immensely valuable due to
       its ability to greatly extend the range of long distance telephones
       and especially submarine ones.</p>
